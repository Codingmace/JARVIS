# JARVIS
 The Personal Assistant that I will name Jarvis Until Further Notice
 I wanted to build an assistant that is more advanced than the simple ones out their. Like a real JARVIS. Able to learn and pick up new things. I will be citing other peoples code becuase I do not have the capability of writing everything but will be writting a majority of it.
EVERYTHING IS COMMAND BASED
